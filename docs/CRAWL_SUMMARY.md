## Document Statistics

- **Total documents crawled**: 17
- **Swift.org pages**: 9
- **Apple Developer pages**: 1
- **Community blog posts**: 4
- **GitHub content**: 2
- **Pending**: WWDC session transcripts (requires manual extraction)

## Directory Structure

```
docs/sources/
├── swift-org/          # 9 official Swift documentation pages
├── apple-dev/          # 1 Apple Developer guide
├── blogs/              # 4 community blog posts
├── github/             # 2 repository documentation files
└── wwdc/               # Empty - pending WWDC transcripts
```

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Migration Strategies**: Step-by-step guides for migrating to Swift 6
2. **Data Race Safety**: Fundamental concepts and implementation
3. **Actor Isolation**: Default actor isolation and patterns
4. **Incremental Adoption**: Techniques for gradual migration
5. **Common Problems**: Solutions to frequent migration issues
6. **Swift 6.2 Features**: New concurrency improvements
7. **Code Examples**: Real-world patterns from Modern-Concurrency-2025

## Next Steps

1. **WWDC Sessions**: The 4 WWDC session transcripts (266, 268, 270 from 2025; 10170 from 2023) were not processed as they require manual extraction from Apple Developer videos.

2. **Frontier Expansion**: During crawling, several additional URLs were identified that could be valuable:
   - More avanderlee.com concurrency articles
   - donnywals.com Swift concurrency posts
   - Additional Swift Evolution proposals referenced in articles

3. **Consolidation**: All documents now have FrontMatter and are ready for:
   - AI/LLM processing
   - Building a comprehensive Swift 6.2 concurrency guide
   - Creating a searchable knowledge base

## Usage

To use this documentation collection:

```bash
# Search across all documents
grep -r "actor isolation" sources/

# Build a prompt for AI processing
files-to-prompt sources/**/*.md

# Generate consolidated guide
llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05 -p "@sources/ Create a comprehensive Swift 6.2 concurrency migration guide"
```
