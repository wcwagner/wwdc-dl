# SE-0431: `@isolated(any)` Function Types

Jul 5, 2024

Swift uses its type system to model concurrency. An integral part of that system is **functions**. Swift‚Äôs ability to model how functions can behave has expanded pretty dramatically lately. Except, there‚Äôs a substantial gap. We‚Äôve seen many new facilities for expressing concurrency in function *declarations*.

This [proposal](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0431-isolated-any-functions.md) adds a new capability to function *values*.

# The Problem

Every declaration in Swift has some well-defined static isolation. You can **always** determine what the isolation is through code inspection. Closures, however, are special. Their isolation is influenced not just by *where* they are defined, but also by *what* they capture.

This sounds complicated. But, in practice you rarely need to understand or even think about these details. All you need to know is this:

The context of a closure definition matters, but that context is also **lost** when you pass it around.

```swift
func scheduleSomeWork(_ f: @escaping @Sendable () async -> Void) {
	// We've lost all the static isolation information
	// available where f was defined.
	Task {
		await f()
	}
}

func defineClosure() {
	scheduleSomeWork { @MainActor in
		print("I'm on the main actor")
	}
}
```

Here, we‚Äôre defining a closure which will run on the `@MainActor`. But, that isolation is only statically visible in `defineClosure`.

At this point, you may be thinking ‚Äúokaay, but I don‚Äôt get why this is a problem‚Äù. And, I‚Äôm not surprised, because there aren‚Äôt too many situations where this will matter. There is, however, one really important place where it makes a big difference: the `Task` creation APIs.

These create a new top-level asynchronous task. But, which actor should that task run on? This information is encoded in the closure body. When looking at the function‚Äôs *type*, it‚Äôs completely invisible.

But `Task` has to start somewhere, so it first begins with a global executor context. And then the very next thing that happens is the closure hops over to the correct actor. This double hop, aside from being inefficient, has a very significant programmer-visible effect: `Task` does not preserve order.

```swift
Task { print("a") }
Task { print("b") }
Task { print("c") }
```

The ordering here is not well-defined. I have, personally, found this to be extremely difficult to deal with. It makes it incredibly hard to introduce async contexts incrementally. And honestly it‚Äôs just really confusing.

# The Solution

This proposal makes it possible to inspect a function value‚Äôs isolation. A closure annotated with `@isolated(any)` can expose its captured isolation *at runtime*.

```swift
func scheduleSomeWork(_ f: @escaping @Sendable @isolated(any) () async -> Void) {
	// closures have properties now!
	let isolation = f.isolation

	// do something with "isolation" I guess?
}
```

When I first saw this, my initial reaction was confusion. Closures have properties? That looks weird. And then I was like, yeah it‚Äôs just a type of course it can have properties. It‚Äôs actually kind of weird they **didn‚Äôt** have properties before. The type of the `isolation` property matches isolated parameters: `(any Actor)?`.

Aside from making this property available, this annotation has a small effect on semantics. Adding `@isolated(any)` to a closure means it **must** be called with an `await`. This is true even it does not cross an isolation boundary.

# The Implications

I think it was one of those problems that had a bunch of superficial solutions. But, to me, this looks like the exact opposite. This is a deep, fundamental extension to function types. **A lot** of thought went into this proposal. This could have easily been just `@isolated`. But, it is leaving the door open for a future revision that can capture not just the isolation value but also its **type**.

Undefined `Task` ordering has caused me **a lot** of issues. It took me a while to even realize it was happening. Thanks to this proposal, `Task` can now **synchronously** enqueue work onto executors.

However, I really do want to stress that ‚Äúwell-defined‚Äù ordering for `Task` creation is not the same as ‚ÄúFIFO‚Äù. A high priority task can still execute before more-recently-created lower-priority tasks.

# Will it Affect Me?

You definitely want to adopt this if you are passing a closure parameter directly into one of the standard library‚Äôs task creation APIs. Aside from that use-case, I still don‚Äôt have a great feel for when or why you would choose to annotate a parameter with `@isolated(any)`. I don‚Äôt think there are any *downsides* if the closure is already `async`. And, it does buy you some future flexibility. But, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it unless you have a clear idea of why it would be necessary.

```swift
Task { print("a") }
Task { print("b") }
Task { print("c") }
```

But, while we‚Äôre all thinking on that, let‚Äôs also take a moment to celebrate that when compiled with Swift 6, this now always prints:

‚Äúa‚Äù
‚Äúb‚Äù
‚Äúc‚Äù

(Update: I always forget that this ordering applies **exclusively** to isolated contexts. Without an actor, `Task` execution order remains undefined.)
