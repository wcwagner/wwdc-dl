# Source Compatibility

See an overview of potential source compatibility issues.

Swift 6 includes a number of evolution proposals that could potentially affect source compatibility. These are all opt-in for the Swift 5 language mode.

> Note: For the previous release’s Migration Guide, see [Migrating to Swift 5](https://www.swift.org/migration-guide-swift5/).

## Handling Future Enum Cases

[SE-0192](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md): `NonfrozenEnumExhaustivity`

Lack of a required `@unknown default` has changed from a warning to an error.

## Concise magic file names

[SE-0274](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0274-magic-file.md): `ConciseMagicFile`

The special expression `#file` has changed to a human-readable string containing the filename and module name.

## Forward-scan matching for trailing closures

[SE-0286](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0286-forward-scan-trailing-closures.md): `ForwardTrailingClosures`

Could affect code involving multiple, defaulted closure parameters.

## Incremental migration to concurrency checking

[SE-0337](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0337-support-incremental-migration-to-concurrency-checking.md): `StrictConcurrency`

Will introduce errors for any code that risks data races.

> Note: This feature implicitly also enables [Isolated default value expressions](#Isolated-default-value-expressions), [Strict concurrency for global variables](#Strict-concurrency-for-global-variables), and [Region based Isolation](#Region-based-Isolation).

## Implicitly Opened Existentials

[SE-0352](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0352-implicit-open-existentials.md): `ImplicitOpenExistentials`

Could affect overload resolution for functions that involve both existentials and generic types.

## Regex Literals

[SE-0354](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0354-regex-literals.md): `BareSlashRegexLiterals`

Could impact the parsing of code that was previously using a bare slash.

## Deprecate @UIApplicationMain and @NSApplicationMain

[SE-0383](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0383-deprecate-uiapplicationmain-and-nsapplicationmain.md): `DeprecateApplicationMain`

Will introduce an error for any code that has not migrated to using `@main`.

## Importing Forward Declared Objective-C Interfaces and Protocols

[SE-0384](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0384-importing-forward-declared-objc-interfaces-and-protocols.md): `ImportObjcForwardDeclarations`

Will expose previously-invisible types that could conflict with existing sources.

## Remove Actor Isolation Inference caused by Property Wrappers

[SE-0401](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0401-remove-property-wrapper-isolation.md): `DisableOutwardActorInference`

Could change the inferred isolation of a type and its members.

## Isolated default value expressions

[SE-0411](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0411-isolated-default-values.md): `IsolatedDefaultValues`

Will introduce errors for code that risks data races.

## Strict concurrency for global variables

[SE-0412](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0412-strict-concurrency-for-global-variables.md): `GlobalConcurrency`

Will introduce errors for code that risks data races.

## Region based Isolation

[SE-0414](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0414-region-based-isolation.md): `RegionBasedIsolation`

Increases the constraints of the `Actor.assumeIsolated` function.

## Inferring `Sendable` for methods and key path literals

[SE-0418](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0418-inferring-sendable-for-methods.md): `InferSendableFromCaptures`

Could affect overload resolution for functions that differ only by sendability.

## Dynamic actor isolation enforcement from non-strict-concurrency contexts

[SE-0423](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0423-dynamic-actor-isolation.md): `DynamicActorIsolation`

Introduces new assertions that could affect existing code if the runtime isolation does not match expectations.

## Usability of global-actor-isolated types

[SE-0434](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0434-global-actor-isolated-types-usability.md): `GlobalActorIsolatedTypesUsability`

Could affect type inference and overload resolution for functions that are globally-isolated but not `@Sendable`.
